# TODO

1. Explicitly invoke Bash with remote ssh command
2. Think about how to create a manifest install list that goes with the install instead of
   depending on make
3. Consider how to lock down dependency versions
4. Consider how to split the makefile for clarity: test, dist, install, etc.
5. Add a vnctools history file to keep track of the past N or so commands
