# TODO

1. Explicitly invoke Bash in the remote ssh command
2. Think about how to create a manifest install list that goes with the install instead of
   depending on make to figure which files to uninstall.
3. Consider how to lock down dependency versions
4. Add a vnctools history file to keep track of the past N or so commands
